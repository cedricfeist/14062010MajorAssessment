    <p><strong>Pluses: </strong> <ul>
    <li>PHP Development was good. We worked well together and did an equal amount of work. - Cedric, Jordan</li>
    <li>Jordan and Thomas were there for all meetings which helped stay on top of what was done on the PHP side and get an idea of what the first years were doing. - Cedric</li>
    <li>Having Coopers design really helped shape the template of the site quickly - Brody</li>
    <li>Did not have any trouble with CSS or HTML by having past experience although did have to get used to the latest version of Dreamweaver. Few things were changed around but I got used to it quickly. - Brody</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Minuses: </strong> <ul><li>First years students were hard to communicate with. Often no response. Cooper and Brody rarely appeared for meetings - Cedric, Jordan</li>
    <li>A lot of the work was late (week 12) so it was a tight schedule to implement all the php. - Cedric, Jordan</li>
    <li>Github wasn't used much. Partly because PhP required the server, partly because Brody and Cooper didn't commit anything, parrtly because we were too lazy and shared it on the ditweb server. - Cedric</li>
    <li>Our group rarely ever worked as a group due to work, holidays, etc. Although the times we did meet up was very productive. - Brody </li>
    <li>With the lack of communication (both 1st and 2nd years) I fully made the artist page but the time I realised it was pointless the page was already complete. Waste of time… - Brody</li>
    <li>The navigation buttons were a bit weird for some reason. They would not work for some time and then suddenly work after deleting and replacing the first button only. There were no differences between the first one and the others so it was quite strange. Buttons are fine now. - Brody</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> There was little changes made from the original design which were the colour scheme and one navigation button. Main thing that we all struggled with was the communication between each other which resulted in pages getting done late, not knowing what to make and just being oblivious on what’s going with the assignment. From what I seen when we did work together as five we got the skills to make a great website and the teamwork was great although we didn’t do it enough. But the site turned out well and the 2nd years did very well in making backbone components. Again this could have been done better if we had more communication but other than that it was fine. - Brody</p>
